# IslandEngine

Elixir game core

Itâ€™s a game for two players, and each player has a board, which consists of a grid of one hundred coordinates. The grid is labeled with the numbers 1 through 10 across the top for the columns and down the left side for the rows. We name individual coordinates with this row-column combination.

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `island_engine` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:island_engine, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```
